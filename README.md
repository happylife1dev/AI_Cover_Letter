**Application** evaulate and gen cover letter based on given resume and job description and preferences

This code is part of a Streamlit application that serves as a cover letter generator ("Bewerbungsgenerator" in German). Here's a step-by-step explanation of what it does:

Imports and Environment Setup:

It imports the necessary libraries including Streamlit for creating a web app, language model classes, and a function to load environment variables.
It sets up a language model object llm using the ChatOpenAI class, which can be configured with either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 Turbo models (GPT-4 is selected in this code snippet).
Creating the Streamlit App Interface:

It sets a title for the web page as "Bewerbungsgenerator" (Application Generator).
It provides three text areas for users to input their CV ("Lebenslauf"), job description ("Jobbeschreibung"), and an optional style for the cover letter ("Stil").
Generating the Cover Letter:

If the user clicks the "Generieren" (Generate) button, the app constructs a system message that describes the requirements for generating a cover letter in German. This includes formatting the cover letter and ensuring that only the skills mentioned in the CV are included.
If an optional style is provided, it is added to the system message.
A human message is created that includes the user's input for the CV and job description.
The system message and human message are passed to the language model llm, and the result is extracted as the generated cover letter ("anschreiben").
Displaying the Result:

The generated cover letter is displayed under the subheader "Ihr Anschreiben:" (Your Cover Letter:).
The code is a high-level description of the process to generate a cover letter, and it doesn't include the implementation details of the ChatOpenAI class or how the result is extracted and formatted from the language model. It assumes that those parts are handled elsewhere in the code.

The user of this application is given a tailored interface to input the necessary details for generating a cover letter, and the language model assists in creating the content, according to the specifications provided in the system message.
